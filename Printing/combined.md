# Pareto Principle tied to note-taking 

Subatomic: A small portion of activities, particularly note-taking, are emphasized, which significantly enhances intellectual development.

I find this interesting because it underscores the importance of focusing on high-value practices, such as writing, which foster a feedback loop of continuous improvement in thinking and writing skills.

In knowledge work, the Pareto Principle suggests that 20% of the activities contribute to 80% of the achievement, making it especially pertinent in knowledge management.
Whether we are zealous explorers or hesitated, confused overthinkers, the one activity that provides the most value is the habit of routinely writing notes, which are proxy for our ideas. This habit is the foundation of intellectual work.

As journeyman knowledge workers, we tend to the minutia of the 80% of activities that contribute less, arguing the merits of this practice or that piece of software. Still, writing notes make up 20% of the activity, which contributes 80% to knowledge development. With deliberate practice, we clarify our thinking, and our writing improves.

A knowledge craftsman looks to balance activities. They realize that not every activity contributes equally to the goal of developing knowledge, and the craftsmen concentrate on letting go of low-performing practices and focusing their efforts on finding and leaning into the vital few that push the work forward. They develop the humble confidence to discard low-value practices. Writing continues to be a high-value activity. As our writing improves, it creates a feedback loop of improved writing, leading to clarified thinking to improved writing, and so the wheel turns.

### Followup
We randomly encounter interesting ideas, like the sudden scent of baking bread. When we do, they're exhilarating, like a joyous conversation with friends around the table. Yesterday and again today, I had the perfect opportunity to sharpen my writing skills. It seems like you will have a similar opportunity today.

Being different beats being the best. The important thing to remember is that **a few small inputs will produce a majority of your results**. 80/20 Pareto's Rule
Ask what...

* 20% of your possessions do you get the most out of?
* 20% of your time spent gives you the most happiness?
* 20% of the people you like to spend the most time with?
* 20% of clothes do you wear most of the time?
* 20% of the food and exercise you do that produces the most results?
* 20% of your money provides the most value
* 20% of tasks you do are the most efficient

# Writing is thinking 

Writing is how I think. Thoughts are not thinking. They are like the weather, coming and going without any control, maybe just a little prediction, here one minute, gone the next. Tons of clichés can be attributed to thoughts and ‘mind weather.’ But writing tames thoughts, making them concrete, solid, and connected with reality. Writing notes is thinking.

* Writing is thinking - solitude is a form of thinking - protecting my solitude. It is a solitary posture.

     * "If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking." — Leslie Lamport
